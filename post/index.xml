When iterating over a map, the iteration order isn&amp;rsquo;t specified and has no guarantee to be the same from one iteration to the next. So, if you require a certain iteration order, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to create a separate data structure that specifies that order.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show examples of how to specify that iteration order.</description></item><item><title>The books I read in 2020</title><link>http://austingebauer.com/post/2020/books/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://austingebauer.com/post/2020/books/</guid><description>Continuing the tradition that I started in 2019, here are all the books that I&amp;rsquo;m reading in each month of 2020.
Why We Sleep - January Why we sleep is an exploration of all things related to, you guessed it, sleep.
The book covered the topics that I was expecting to learn about, for example, dreams and circadian rhythms. It also covered some topics that I was not expecting to learn about, for example, evolutionary pressures motivating sleep, and sleep in animals.</description></item><item><title>The books I read in 2019</title><link>http://austingebauer.com/post/2019/books/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://austingebauer.com/post/2019/books/</guid><description>In the last quarter of 2019, I decided to read a new book every month. As a tradition, I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting short reviews for each book that I read over each year.
So here are all of the books that I read in 2019, starting with what I read in September and ending with December.
Rework - September Rework is an incredibly insightful business book that questions the status quo and current state of affairs for how things get done in the workplace.</description></item><item><title>Writing a Ray Tracer in Go</title><link>http://austingebauer.com/post/2019/ray-tracing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://austingebauer.com/post/2019/ray-tracing/</guid><description>Table of Contents Motivation Tools for the Job Rendering 1 - Projectile Rendering 2 - Clock Rendering 3 - 2D Spheres Rendering 4 - 3D Spheres Rendering 5 - World Rendering 6 - World with Shadows Motivation I&amp;rsquo;d been curious about how graphics worked since playing video games as a child.
