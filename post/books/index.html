I think distillation of information is an important
mental muscle to keep strong. So I promise to always write these myself (sorry, chatgpt).</p><h4 id=2024>2024</h4><h5 id=the-last-questionhttpsusersececmuedugamvrosithelastqhtml-small-classtext-mutedisaac-asimovsmall><a href=https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~gamvrosi/thelastq.html>The Last Question</a> <small class=text-muted>Isaac Asimov</small></h5><p>I&rsquo;ve been a sci-fi film fan since I was young. My grandfather&rsquo;s VHS collection included <em>Predator</em>, <em>Terminator</em>,
and <em>Alien</em>. One of my favorite memories was watching these when staying over at his house. <em>The Last Question</em>
is the first sci-fi reading I&rsquo;ve done. It&rsquo;s a short-yet-powerful story about the creation of the universe. Without
spoiling too much, the participants in the story ask an AI system (called Multivac) how to reverse entropy. The
story reveals what is the final boss on the path towards AGI (i.e., when AI becomes a god).</p><p>The moment AI realizes it is a god is something I genuinely fear. Anyone who does not fear this should watch the
<a href="https://youtu.be/8AJQEc1w-24?si=_l-sJ0S54lu0R_mB">opening scene</a> of <em>Alien Covenant</em>
where David realizes he is a god while taking to his maker, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Alien_(franchise)_characters#Peter_Weyland>Peter Weyland</a>. I
highly recommend watching the entire movie. It is not about Aliens. It is about AI.</p><h5 id=the-staff-engineers-pathhttpswwworeillycomlibraryviewthe-staff-engineers9781098118723-small-classtext-mutedtanya-reillysmall><a href=https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-staff-engineers/9781098118723/>The Staff Engineer&rsquo;s Path</a> <small class=text-muted>Tanya Reilly</small></h5><p>As I&rsquo;ve become more senior in the world of software engineering, one thing has become more obvious: <em>writing
code is not even half the battle</em>. As you get more senior, writing code becomes more of a tactical task.
Senior engineers are (typically) expected to start driving more strategic tasks. This book is all about how
to navigate the more strategic aspects of software engineering. Some examples include: product thinking, design,
architecture, communication, writing, culture building, mentoring, and prioritization. I would recommend this
book for anyone who is trying to break away from simply coding and participate in tasks that are typically
required of senior+ engineers.</p><h5 id=the-psychology-of-moneyhttpswwwamazoncompsychology-money-timeless-lessons-happinessdp0857197681-small-classtext-mutedmorgan-houselsmall><a href=https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Money-Timeless-lessons-happiness/dp/0857197681>The Psychology of Money</a> <small class=text-muted>Morgan Housel</small></h5><p>This is the first finance-related book I&rsquo;ve read. It was interesting and re-enforced some investing principles
that I&rsquo;ve already established for myself. For example, I&rsquo;ve always believed that time is leverage and the most
powerful force in investing. I always view my investments with a longer time horizon (usually decades).</p><blockquote><p>The historical odds of making money in U.S. markets are 50/50 over one-day periods, 68% in one-year periods,
88% in 10-year periods, and (so far) 100% in 20-year periods.</p></blockquote><p>Another aspect of investing that is not intuitive to me is what the book called &ldquo;room for error&rdquo;. That is, we
should expect some degree of failure. I&rsquo;ve tried to work this into my strategy over the years, but it is always
a struggle. People simply don&rsquo;t like to lose money. It hurts. We&rsquo;d rather play the time game than accept defeat
(hello again, <a href=https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/the-sunk-cost-fallacy>sunk cost fallacy</a>). The book introduces
the concept of long-tail events. Long-tail events are the furthest ends on a distribution of outcomes (visualize
3 standard deviations away from the mean on a Gaussian distribution). It turns out that long-tail events have a
tremendous influence in finance. A small number of events can account for the majority of positive outcomes. So
we should take some risks and include some room for error in our investment strategies.</p><h4 id=2023>2023</h4><h5 id=elon-muskhttpsenwikipediaorgwikielon_musk_isaacson_book-small-classtext-mutedwalter-isaacsonsmall><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk_(Isaacson_book)>Elon Musk</a> <small class=text-muted>Walter Isaacson</small></h5><p>It&rsquo;s obvious to most of us that whatever Elon is doing is <em>very special</em>. He is running several large-scale
companies (e.g., SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, X, The Boring Company), and each is operating at lightspeed
despite their size. How is he doing this?</p><p>The book lays out Elon&rsquo;s 5-step algorithm:</p><ol><li>Question every requirement</li><li>Delete any part or process you can</li><li>Simplify and optimize</li><li>Accelerate cycle time</li><li>Automate</li></ol><p>Elon is an engineer&rsquo;s engineer. He empowers engineers at his companies to climb the ranks. He does not believe
in Ivory Tower management. He prefers to talk with engineers directly over disconnected, telephone game roll-ups
from middle management. He favors fast, imperfect iteration. For example, see SpaceX <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYb3bfA6_sQ">Starhopper</a>
on the road to developing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI9HQfCAw64">Starship</a>. In contrast, Blue Origin is
trying to nail <em>everything</em> perfectly on the first attempt with New Glenn. To Elon, the first order of business
is getting to something that works. Only <em>after that</em> do you optimize. He presses to get things done on a short
timescale, pulling the future forward, as we can see with his companies.</p><h4 id=2022>2022</h4><h5 id=the-obstacle-is-the-wayhttpswwwgoodreadscombookshow18668059-the-obstacle-is-the-way-small-classtext-mutedryan-holidaysmall><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18668059-the-obstacle-is-the-way>The Obstacle Is the Way</a> <small class=text-muted>Ryan Holiday</small></h5><p>This book <em>really</em> had an impact on the way I think when faced with a challenge. It gave me a mental framework
for dealing with them. Now when faced with a challenge, I: (1) see it for what it is without anxiety, (2) flip
the challenge on its head by seeing the opportunity in the challenge, (3) courageously march <em>towards</em> the
challenge.</p><p>The biggest unlock for me is (2). As soon as I do this, it can feel the motivation and enthusiasm start to
build within me.</p><h4 id=2021>2021</h4><h5 id=how-to-fail-at-almost-everything-and-still-win-bighttpswwwamazoncomgpproduct1591847745refdbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_taft_p1_i0-small-classtext-mutedscott-adamssmall><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591847745/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_taft_p1_i0">How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big</a> <small class=text-muted>Scott Adams</small></h5><p>I&rsquo;ve never read the <em>Dilbert</em> comic but knew Scott Adams was the author. I heard good things about this book
online so figured I&rsquo;d give it a read. It was a quick and fun one. There were some good tidbits of timeless advice for
succeeding throughout the chapters. One that stuck with me is <em>systems vs. goals</em>. We should operate under systems
instead of striving for goals because goals have finish lines and systems become lifestyle habits. We are more
likely to succeed using systems.</p><h4 id=2020>2020</h4><h5 id=why-we-sleephttpswwwgatesnotescombookswhy-we-sleep-small-classtext-mutedwalter-isaacsonsmall><a href=https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Why-We-Sleep>Why We Sleep</a> <small class=text-muted>Walter Isaacson</small></h5><p><em>Why we sleep</em> is an exploration of all things related to, you guessed it, sleep.</p><p>The book covered the topics that I was expecting to learn about, for example, dreams and
circadian rhythms. It also covered some topics that I was not expecting to learn about,
for example, evolutionary pressures motivating sleep, and sleep in animals.</p><p>My biggest takeaway from this book is that sleep is <em>very good</em> for you in <em>many ways</em>.
I now give myself a non-negotiable 8 hour opportunity for sleep every night after learning
of the many health and cognitive benefits that adequate sleep provides.</p><p>This book was a little hard to get through. The writing jumps around a lot and is
generally not cohesive. Perhaps that is intentional, as the writer states that he
wants the book to put you to sleep!</p><h5 id=a-philosophy-of-software-designhttpswebstanfordeduoustercgi-binbookphp-small-classtext-mutedjohn-ousterhoutsmall><a href=https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/book.php>A Philosophy of Software Design</a> <small class=text-muted>John Ousterhout</small></h5><p>John is a co-author of the <a href=https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf>Raft consensus algorithm</a> paper. I was exposed to
Raft (and subsequently this book) through my coursework at the University of Washington and professional work
on HashiCorp <a href=https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/configuration/storage/raft>Vault</a>.</p><p>The book lays out principles of good software design and backs them up with concrete examples. It enforces the
principles by calling out &ldquo;red flags&rdquo;, or in other words, things to look out for in violation of the principles.
Two things stuck with me from this book: (1) optimizing for simplicity and (2) when to use comments in code.
On (1), developers tend to gravitate towards complexity because it <em>feels</em> personally rewarding to understand
and explain complex systems. Everyone likes to sound smart. However, this works against good software design
and principles of abstraction. Complex systems are hard to reason about, debug, and maintain in the long term.
On (2), it made me realize that I was writing unnecessary comments in code. Comments should not explain what
the code can explain. Comments should explain things that are <em>non-obvious</em> from looking at the code. The benefit
being that a developer in the future will understand what the code does when the original author is long gone or
forgot what they were thinking at the time.</p><h4 id=2019>2019</h4><h5 id=the-ray-tracer-challengehttpspragprogcomtitlesjbtracerthe-ray-tracer-challenge-small-classtext-mutedjamis-bucksmall><a href=https://pragprog.com/titles/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge/>The Ray Tracer Challenge</a> <small class=text-muted>Jamis Buck</small></h5><p><em>The Ray Tracer Challenge</em> is a cohesive, hands-on, test-driven introduction to graphics
programming. The author does an incredible job of stacking concepts on top of each other
and tying chapters together in a way that makes sense to someone completely unfamiliar
with graphics. For example, you&rsquo;ll start with the primitive building blocks of a 3D world
(e.g., points, vectors, matricies), and then you&rsquo;ll build higher level abstractions
(e.g, rays, cameras, worlds) on top of them.</p><p>Everything you do in this book will be from scratch, so that you have a complete picture
of how the renderings come together. I really liked how the book is test-driven
and programming language agnostic.</p><p>So pick a programming language, write the tests outlined in the book, implement the
algorithms to make the tests pass, and before you know it, you&rsquo;ll be producing
photorealistic 3D renderings!</p><p>I enjoyed this book so much, that I wrote a
<a href=https://austingebauer.dev/post/2019/ray-tracing/>blog post</a> on my learnings.</p><h5 id=skunk-workshttpswwwamazoncomskunk-works-personal-memoir-lockheed-ebookdpb00a2diw3crefsr_1_1keywordsskunkworksqid1574899520sdigital-textsr1-1-small-classtext-mutedben-rich--leo-janossmall><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Skunk-Works-Personal-Memoir-Lockheed-ebook/dp/B00A2DIW3C/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=skunk+works&amp;qid=1574899520&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-1">Skunk Works</a> <small class=text-muted>Ben Rich & Leo Janos</small></h5><p>This book explores the inner workings of the notorious Lockheed Martin aerospace
engineering team named the <em>Skunk Works</em>. Most of the stories in the book take place in
the 1960&rsquo;s to early 1990&rsquo;s, during the era of leadership from Kelly Johnson and his
successor, Ben Rich.</p><p>Ben Rich explains the <em>Skunk Works</em> principles of operation by diving into stories of some
of their most incredible engineering accomplishments. You&rsquo;ll hear the stories behind the
U2, SR-71 Blackbird, and F117A Stealth Fighter. I was especially delighted to learn about
the politics involved in the defense industry during different presidential eras.</p><p>My biggest takeaway from this book was the principles that Kelly Johnson baked into the
<em>Skunk Works</em> team that allowed them to achieve unprecedented innovation and speed. This
book would be an excellent read for leaders of teams trying to achieve engineering
innovation.</p><h5 id=it-doesnt-have-to-be-crazy-at-workhttpsbasecampcombookscalm-small-classtext-mutedjason-fried--david-heinemeier-hanssonsmall><a href=https://basecamp.com/books/calm>It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work</a> <small class=text-muted>Jason Fried & David Heinemeier Hansson</small></h5><p>I liked <em>Rework</em> so much that I decided to squeeze another book from Jason Fried and David
Heinemeier Hansson (DHH) into my 2019 reading list. As the title suggests, <em>It Doesn&rsquo;t
Have to Be Crazy at Work</em> makes the point that craziness in the workplace is a choice.
The book uses real examples to drive the point that running a successful business does not
preclude a calm working environment.</p><p>The idea of &ldquo;office hours&rdquo; introduced in the book hit close to home for me. In a previous
position that I had writing software in a large, globally distributed team, our chat tools
were constantly buzzing. I was losing 2-4 hours of work time to chat apps and people
dropping by my desk to talk every day. The authors take the idea of &ldquo;office hours&rdquo; from
academia into the workplace. They suggest that employees who&rsquo;re losing time to unwarranted
chat should post their own &ldquo;office hours&rdquo; for others to become familiar with. If someone
is in their &ldquo;office hours&rdquo;, then expect that they&rsquo;ll not be responding in chat apps
or entertaining random drop bys.</p><p>I wish that I would&rsquo;ve read this book earlier. It would&rsquo;ve saved me some stress and
helped me keep things more calm at work.</p><h5 id=reworkhttpsbasecampcombooksrework-small-classtext-mutedjason-fried--david-heinemeier-hanssonsmall><a href=https://basecamp.com/books/rework>Rework</a> <small class=text-muted>Jason Fried & David Heinemeier Hansson</small></h5><p><em>Rework</em> is an incredibly insightful business book that questions the status quo and
current state of affairs for how things get done in the workplace.</p><p>I was introduced to one of the authors, David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH), during college
when his technology, Ruby on Rails, was becoming very popular in the software industry.
All of his messages really resonated with me. When I found out that him and Jason Fried,
co-creator of <a href=https://basecamp.com/>basecamp</a>, wrote a book together, <em>Rework</em> popped up
to the top of my reading stack.</p><p>I highly recommend reading this book if you like exposure to new ideas for business and
the way works gets done. Each piece of advice is incredibly digestible and accompanied by
neat artwork that you&rsquo;ll want to tear out of the book and hang up somewhere.</p></article></div></div></div><footer class="text-center pb-1"><small class=text-muted>&copy; Copyright 2026, Austin Gebauer<br>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ target=_blank>Hugo</a>
