As a tradition,
I&rsquo;ll be posting short reviews for each book that I read over each year.</p><p>So here are all of the books that I read in 2019, starting with what I read in September
and ending with December.</p><h4 id=reworkhttpsbasecampcombooksreworksmall---septembersmall><a href=https://basecamp.com/books/rework target=_blank>Rework</a>
<small>- September</small></h4><p><em>Rework</em> is an incredibly insightful business book that questions the status quo and
current state of affairs for how things get done in the workplace.</p><p>I was introduced to one of the authors, David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH), during college
when his technology, Ruby on Rails, was becoming very popular in the software industry.
All of his messages really resonated with me. When I found out that him and Jason Fried,
co-creator of <a href=https://basecamp.com/ target=_blank>basecamp</a>
, wrote a book together, <em>Rework</em> popped up
to the top of my reading stack.</p><p>I highly recommend reading this book if you like exposure to new ideas for business and
the way works gets done. Each piece of advice is incredibly digestible and accompanied by
neat artwork that you&rsquo;ll want to tear out of the book and hang up somewhere.</p><h4 id=the-ray-tracer-challengehttpspragprogcombookjbtracerthe-ray-tracer-challengesmall---octobersmall><a href=https://pragprog.com/book/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge target=_blank>The Ray Tracer Challenge</a>
<small>- October</small></h4><p><em>The Ray Tracer Challenge</em> is a cohesive, hands-on, test-driven introduction to graphics
programming. The author does an incredible job of stacking concepts on top of each other
and tying chapters together in a way that makes sense to someone completely unfamiliar
with graphics. For example, you&rsquo;ll start with the primitive building blocks of a 3D world
(e.g., points, vectors, matricies), and then you&rsquo;ll build higher level abstractions
(e.g, rays, cameras, worlds) on top of them.</p><p>Everything you do in this book will be from scratch, so that you have a complete picture
of how the renderings come together. I really liked how the book is test-driven
and programming language agnostic.</p><p>So pick a programming language, write the tests outlined in the book, implement the
algorithms to make the tests pass, and before you know it, you&rsquo;ll be producing
photorealistic 3D renderings!</p><p>I enjoyed this book so much, that I wrote a
<a href=https://austingebauer.com/posts/2019/ray-tracing/ target=_blank>blog post</a>
on my learnings.</p><h4 id=skunk-workshttpswwwamazoncomskunk-works-personal-memoir-lockheed-ebookdpb00a2diw3crefsr_1_1keywordsskunkworksqid1574899520sdigital-textsr1-1small---novembersmall><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Skunk-Works-Personal-Memoir-Lockheed-ebook/dp/B00A2DIW3C/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=skunk+works&qid=1574899520&s=digital-text&sr=1-1" target=_blank>Skunk Works</a>
<small>- November</small></h4><p>This book explores the inner workings of the notorious Lockheed Martin aerospace
engineering team named the <em>Skunk Works</em>. Most of the stories in the book take place in
the 1960&rsquo;s to early 1990&rsquo;s, during the era of leadership from Kelly Johnson and his
successor, Ben Rich.</p><p>Ben Rich explains the <em>Skunk Works</em> principles of operation by diving into stories of some
of their most incredible engineering accomplishments. You&rsquo;ll hear the stories behind the
U2, SR-71 Blackbird, and F117A Stealth Fighter. I was especially delighted to learn about
the politics involved in the defense industry during different presidential eras.</p><p>My biggest takeaway from this book was the principles that Kelly Johnson baked into the
<em>Skunk Works</em> team that allowed them to achieve unprecedented innovation and speed. This
book would be an excellent read for leaders of teams trying to achieve engineering
innovation.</p><h4 id=it-doesnt-have-to-be-crazy-at-workhttpsbasecampcombookscalmsmall---decembersmall><a href=https://basecamp.com/books/calm target=_blank>It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work</a>
<small>- December</small></h4><p>I liked <em>Rework</em> so much that I decided to squeeze another book from Jason Fried and David
Heinemeier Hansson (DHH) into my 2019 reading list. As the title suggests, <em>It Doesn&rsquo;t
Have to Be Crazy at Work</em> makes the point that craziness in the workplace is a choice.
The book uses real examples to drive the point that running a successful business does not
preclude a calm working environment.</p><p>The idea of &ldquo;office hours&rdquo; introduced in the book hit close to home for me. In a previous
position that I had writing software in a large, globally distributed team, our chat tools
were constantly buzzing. I was losing 2-4 hours of work time to chat apps and people
dropping by my desk to talk every day. The authors take the idea of &ldquo;office hours&rdquo; from
academia into the workplace. They suggest that employees who&rsquo;re losing time to unwarranted
chat should post their own &ldquo;office hours&rdquo; for others to become familiar with. If someone
is in their &ldquo;office hours&rdquo;, then expect that they&rsquo;ll not be responding in chat apps
or entertaining random drop bys.</p><p>I wish that I would&rsquo;ve read this book earlier. It would&rsquo;ve saved me some stress and
helped me keep things more calm at work.</p></article></div></div></div><footer class="text-center pb-1"><small class=text-muted>&copy; Copyright 2020, Austin Gebauer<br>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ target=_blank>Hugo</a>
