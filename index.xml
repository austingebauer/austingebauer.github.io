      <title>Sorting maps in Go</title>

      <description>Go provides a built-in map type that implements a hash table (i.e., associative array that can map keys to values).
When iterating over a map, the iteration order isn&#39;t specified and has no guarantee to be the same from one iteration to the next. So, if you require a certain iteration order, you&#39;ll need to create a separate data structure that specifies that order.
In this post, I&#39;ll show examples of how to specify that iteration order.</description>

      <description>In the last quarter of 2019, I decided to read a new book every month. As a tradition, I&#39;ll be posting short reviews for each book that I read over each year.
So here are all of the books that I read in 2019, starting with what I read in September and ending with December.
Rework  - September Rework is an incredibly insightful business book that questions the status quo and current state of affairs for how things get done in the workplace.</description>
