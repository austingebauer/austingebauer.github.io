      <description>In the last quarter of 2019, I decided to read a new book every month. As a tradition, I&#39;ll be posting short reviews for each book that I read over each year.
So here are all of the books that I read in 2019, starting with what I read in September and ending with December.
Rework  - September Rework is an incredibly insightful business book that questions the status quo and current state of affairs for how things get done in the workplace.</description>
