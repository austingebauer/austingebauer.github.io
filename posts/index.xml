      <description>Go provides a built-in map type that implements a hash table (i.e., associative array that can map keys to values).
In this post, I&#39;ll present a problem and show examples of how to solve it by sorting the contents of a Go map by keys and/or values.
Example Problem Imagine that we have a set of movie titles, each with an association to the number of likes the movie has received.</description>

      <description>In the last quarter of 2019, I decided to read a new book every month. As a tradition, I&#39;ll be posting short reviews for each book that I read over each year.
So here are all of the books that I read in 2019, starting with what I read in September and ending with December.
Rework  - September Rework is an incredibly insightful business book that questions the status quo and current state of affairs for how things get done in the workplace.</description>
